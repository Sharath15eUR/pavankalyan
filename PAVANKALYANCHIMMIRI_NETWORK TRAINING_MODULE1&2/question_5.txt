5. Understand what happens when duplicateIPs configured in a network

my solution:

when two devices on the same network are assigned the same IP addresss, it creates an IP conflict, leading to various connectivity
issues.

ISSUES ARISES LIKE:

-> May lose internet access or have a unstable connection
-> The two devices compete for communication
-> IP conflict notification will be generated by OS
-> Devices become unreachable

Cause of Duplicate IPs
-> static IP Conflict
-> DHCP misconfiguration
->Rouge device in Network

How to solve this issue:

-> using DHCP instead of static IPs
->should check for misconfigured Devices
->using arp and ping tests
